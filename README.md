## 1. Project Overview
This open-source mecha-themed chess project prioritizes **influence expansion** and **community building** over short-term profits. It follows the core logic of *"You Build the Stage, Players Put on the Show"*—the official team develops the basic framework, while players contribute creative content to drive ecological growth.

---

## 2. Core Framework
The project adopts a dual-drive structure to balance stability and innovation:
### 2.1 Classic Mode
- Based on traditional chess rules with **mecha-style transformation** for all pieces (chariot, horse, cannon, etc.).
- Retains core competitive logic, serving as the entry point for new players and the foundation of the entire project.
### 2.2 Creative Workshop
- Opens permissions for players to design **custom mecha pieces** and **innovative gameplay rules**.
- The official team only undertakes content review and bottom-line supervision, ensuring a free and standardized creation environment.

## 3. Operation & Rule System
### 3.1 Four-Level Content Review Process
To guarantee content quality and compliance, all player submissions go through:
1. **Creator Self-Check**: Pre-submission verification via built-in templates and rule prompts.
2. **Automated Preliminary Screening**: AI-based filtering for obvious violations, imbalance, or technical incompatibility.
3. **Manual Recheck**: In-depth review by the team for logical rationality and user experience.
4. **Post-Launch Monitoring**: 24/7 system inspection + player reporting channel for ongoing quality control.

### 3.2 Copyright & Monetization Rules
- **Copyright Ownership**: Players retain full copyright of their original works; the platform only obtains non-exclusive usage rights.
- **Monetization Methods**:
  1. One-Time Copyright Transfer
  2. Authorization License (royalty based on usage/download volume)
  3. Platform Preferred Procurement (official purchase of high-quality content)
- **Transaction Security**: Funds are held in escrow by the platform until the rights transfer is completed.

### 3.3 High-Quality Content Procurement Criteria
Content selection is based on **data-driven popularity** and **player demand**:
- **Popularity Metrics**: Weekly active user growth rate > 50%, average stay time 2x higher than the average, top 10% in share volume.
- **Demand Metrics**: Positive feedback rate > 80%, high votes in official polls, or widespread calls for official inclusion.
- **Post-Procurement Actions**: Optimize compatibility, add exclusive special effects, mark creator attribution, and launch the content as an official feature.

## 4. Gameplay Directions
Focus on pure strategic innovation, rejecting numerical development mechanics. Core directions include:
1. **Faction Confrontation**: Pieces belong to factions (Steampunk/Cyberpunk/Star Mecha) with exclusive chessboard buffs (e.g., burning trails, temporary invisibility). Victory depends on faction counterplay and chess skills.
2. **Time-Limited Rule Battles**: Random temporary rules per game (e.g., "Cannons can jump over any number of pieces", "Horses are not blocked", "Destroyed chariots trigger self-explosion").
3. **Random Battlefield Drops**: One-time buff/debuff items (power core, electromagnetic jammer, emergency repair kit) dropped at the start of rounds or after capturing pieces. Disadvantaged players have a higher probability of obtaining powerful props.
4. **Endgame Challenge Mode**: Creators design high-difficulty mecha chess endgames; the fastest solver wins custom mecha skin rewards.

## 5. Core Value & Long-Term Vision
### 5.1 Core Value
- **Ecosystem-Driven**: Open-source model attracts like-minded developers and players, forming a sustainable cycle of *Creation → Screening → Optimization → Dissemination*.
- **Differentiation Advantage**: Pure strategic gameplay avoids industry clichés (gacha, pay-to-win), targeting hardcore strategy game lovers.
- **Talent Screening**: Accurately identify technical (coding/modeling) and creative (gameplay design) talents through practical works, building a high-quality talent pool.

### 5.2 Long-Term Vision
| Stage | Goals |
|-------|-------|
| **Short-Term** | Complete Classic Mode development; launch Creative Workshop basic framework; start community operation. |
| **Medium-Term** | Build an online *Game University* for practical training; connect with game industry for talent employment. |
| **Long-Term** | Establish a physical game university; create a full-chain ecosystem of *Learning → Practice → Employment*. |

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: Develop Classic Mode core functions (mecha modeling, chess rule logic implementation).
2. **Phase 2 (Expansion)**: Build Creative Workshop and four-level review system; open custom piece creation.
3. **Phase 3 (Optimization)**: Launch popularity monitoring and demand collection system; activate content procurement mechanism.
4. **Phase 4 (Ecosystem)**: Iterate gameplay; improve copyright trading system; promote open-source dissemination and community precipitation.

## 7. Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from developers, 3D modelers, and gameplay designers who love mecha and strategy games:
- **Code Contribution**: Optimize chess AI algorithm, develop review scripts, or improve system compatibility (Python preferred).
- **Model Contribution**: Design mecha pieces that fit the project's style; low-poly models with clear textures are preferred.
- **Gameplay Contribution**: Submit pure strategic gameplay ideas with detailed rule descriptions and balance test plans.
- **How to Contribute**: Fork the repository → Submit a pull request → Pass review → Merge to main branch.
